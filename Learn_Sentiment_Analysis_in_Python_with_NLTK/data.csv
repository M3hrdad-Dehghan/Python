3,Video Four,"Hello all.  I'm posting sentdex's code again with significant comments describing each step of the code.  If people could please review this and let me know if I've made any errors, I'd greatly appreciate it.

# We're using quandl.com as our data source.  We're going to get the stock information for Google 
# and use it for our regression example. 
stock_df = quandl.get('WIKI/GOOGL')

# We need to figure out what features of this data set to use for our stock price prediction.
# We'll choose only somewhat relevant features, in this case the Adjusted open, Adjusted close,
# The adjusted high and low stock price, the Adjusted close and the Adjusted volume. 
# Note that 'Adjusted' simply means the price of the stock after such things as  stock splits. 
# We could use the non-adjusted features as well, but using both adjusted and non-adjusted is 
# not useful as they both essentially describe the same things. 

stock_df = stock_df[['Adj. Open','Adj. High','Adj. Low','Adj. Close','Adj. Volume']]


# Here, we're going to create two new features computed from the features already given 
# in the data set.  # We're going to need these features to track volatility in the stock
# which is an essential feature for predicting a new stock price. 

#The first features is the high low percentage, calculated by subtracting the
# adjusted high price from the close and dividing by the close multiplied by 100.0 (to get a proper percentage value)
#
stock_df['HL_PCT'] = (stock_df['Adj. High'] - stock_df['Adj. Close'] ) / stock_df ['Adj. Close'] * 100.0

# Our next features is the Percentage price change obtained by subtracting the adjusted close
# from the adjusted open and dividing  by the adjusted open multiplied by 100.0
stock_df['PCT_change']  = (stock_df['Adj. Close'] - stock_df['Adj. Open']) / stock_df['Adj. Open'] * 100.0 

#print (stock_df.head())
#%save stock_example1.py


# Once we have the features, we want to then get the labels, i.e. for a classifier, we want to know
# whether or not we have a True or a False value. 

# Here we're using the Adjusted close as our label name.  
forecast_col = 'Adj. Close'

# With machine learning, we will replace any NaN values with a real number (even though it's an outlier). 
# This is a better choice than getting rid of columns that don't have all the data. 
stock_df.fillna(-99999, inplace=True)

# Now we'll define our regression algorithm
# Let's first set how many days back we want to go  as a percentage of the number of days in the data frame. 
# Here we'll set it to go back ten percent of the total number of days in the data frame. 
days_back = 0.1 
forecast_out = int(math.ceil(days_back*len(stock_df)))

# Here we use the pandas shift method to shift the forecast label values out by the amount
# specified in the forecast_out variable.  Basically, the label will contain the adjusted close
# value ten days (as specified by the forecast_out variable) into the future. 

stock_df['label'] = stock_df[forecast_col].shift(-forecast_out)
stock_df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Now, from our dataframe, let's get both our test data (X) and our label (y) that we will feed into our 
# linear regression model.  Note that the test
X = np.array(stock_df.drop(['label'],1))
y = np.array(stock_df['label'])

# The preprocessing module from sklearn 'normalizes' our features, that is to say, it tries to 
# make sure that for each feature given, the values range roughly by one unit.  So, for example
# having features range in value between -1 and 1 or =0.5 to 0.5. 
# The reason for doing this is to hopefully speed up the execution of the linear regression algorithm.  

X = preprocessing.scale(X)

# Now, let's get two sets of values.  
# Set 1.  The training data for our linear regression algorithm.
# Set 2.  The testing data to see how well our algorithm learned from the training data. 

# Here we're going to split up the data we got from Quandl for the training feature data (X_train) and the training label data (y_train)
# and the testing feature data (X_test) and the testing label data (y_test)

X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2)

# Let's choose the SKLearn's Linear Regression algorithnm for our ML example
clf=LinearRegression()

# Let's run the training data through the algorithm. 
clf.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Now let's see how well the training set compares to the testing data. 
accuracy=clf.score(X_test,y_test)

print (accuracy)

# A good result is to have an accuracy of 75 per cent or better (usually rather difficult to
# achieve with real world training sets)"
4,Video Four,"I have tried many other courses and tutorial but most of them explain only the theory and no coding or just use inbuilt libraries for everything. And finally, I found his series where we code an algorithm from scratch. I can't thank you  enough for making this awesome tutorial series"
5,Video Four,"Interestingly enough, I'm getting almost the same accuracy % with SVR/poly kernel, which is around 72%. I'm using the same stock data as well. Just sharing my results :) Thanks so much for these awesome tut's, mate!"
6,Video Four,"Hey Harrison! Love your tutorials. Just a couple of suggestions on this one: 

a) on the ""preprocessing using the train"" thing, I guess the main thing also is that all sorts of estimates, parameters, etc must eb strictly computed from the training data only, so when you get future data you must re-use the parameters that you learned & saved at the time of training 

b) it would be nice to explain why the accuracy keeps changing everytime you re-run, mentioning the seed in the cross validation process"
7,Video Four,"I love your videos.  I would like to understand the principles of AI and since I'm a developer (been developing software since the 1970's) I figured I'd use these tutorials to learn, but there are too many pieces I'm not familiar with, such as sklearn, numpy, pandas, etc.  Any suggestions as a better place to start.  Thanks again for sharing your expertise."
8,Video Four,"HI, sentdex! This is a great tutorial. I am not a native speaker and very new to Python (3 weeks). But so far this is very clear to me. Thank you very much."
9,Video Four,"Hey Sentdex! Thanks heaps for these great tutorials, keep up the great work. I am now getting a deprecation warning on the cross validation. Could you do a quick update on how we are supposed to train, test and cross validate with the new model_selection module please? I have tried making it work but my understanding is that clf won't initialise properly because cross_val_score performs the fitting on a copy of the estimator rather than the original...can you help?"
10,Video Four,"Great video series indeed! I would just like to point out for those just tickling the subject, the high accuracy output from this model is rather misleading (no flame intended on the content creator, I actually do admire your work and want you to keep making these amazing videos!). The problem occurs when the data is scaled. In practice when you scale training and validation sets together you are introducing a huge bias into your training set from your validation set due to the way the data is scaled. It is as if, when you scale data that way, your training set gets a huge ""peek"" into the future thus resulting on the obscenely high accuracies observed. Just food for thought. Anyway. Great video! Thanks for posting."
11,Video Four,"I'm from Brazil and do not quite understand the English language, but this course is very good, I'm able to follow without problems ... Congratulations to Sentdex !!!

I had some different results when applying the svm.SVR; when the (kernel = 'poly'), Python locked and closed.

Nothing to panic, I will study more to see where the error is."
12,Video Four,I know im late but for anyone who is interested. The high accuracy is due to a problem of high correlation between label and Adj. Close which is include as one of the features. basically we are using previous values of our label as an explicative variable. u cant do that in linear regression. u cant use AR models here. So i recommend to drop Adj. Close of your features then uÂ´ll see that the accuary goes down.
13,Video Four,Really interesting series. Watching it as I am taking a course on multivariate statistical methods.
14,Video Four,"Hi there. Thanks so much for the videos! I've learnt so much in a v short period of time. I was wondering if you might be able to explain how the cross validation works with time series data? You mentioned in the video that it ""shuffles"" data around, but could this lose information derived from daily movements? Thanks"
15,Video Four,"great series if you take some time and learn the reason for using cross validation and the syntax of pandas, numpy, and sklearn. if i was making the tutorial i might have used a simpler dataset, such as iris. i think the concept of stocks is another barrier to understand while the focus should really only be on the theory of linear regression and the machine learning concepts. if you are having a hard time understanding things, go read the docs for all these libraries and even watch a short series on pandas and numpy, it helped a lot for me."
16,Video Four,"Hey, I'm really glad that you did a tutorial on Machine Learning!
Thanks a lot.

As a piece of information, when I tried to run the code in my machine I had to previously install the package 'scipy' in order to make the code work."
17,Video Four,"Great video, as always. I see that scipy and scikit-learn both can do linear regression. Any reason to use sklearn over scipy? I see that scipy is much faster to fit a line and get R^2. Thanks!"
18,Video Four,"These are awesome man thanks!  Do you plan on doing any sort of overview with Logistic Regression as well? I use logistic a lot at work, since I'm often trying to predict binary outcomes."
19,Video Four,"I think the problem of getting high ""accuracy"" (=R^2 coefficient) with using this Linear Regression Model on our data, is due to the fact our label data spans from quite a low number (~50) to quite a high number (~800) and has a very high variance in itself (even for a shuffled test set). It just so happens that stock prices tend to stay in the vicinity of what it used to be - even 30 days after/ago (unless some really crazy things happened and the stock flies up or plunges). So our model variance (Sum of Squared Errors) would be relatively small (compared with the overall label variance). 

So actually our model is not that great, but when calculating the R^2 coefficient which is the ""accuracy"" - the overall variance of our label-data is so great compared with the model variance, that we get a ""good accuracy"". 

If we take, say - only the last 110 days, shift 10, so we have 100 features values, and 100 labels, train it on 80 and test it on 20 - we will get (unsurprisingly) really bad results (when I ran this R^2/Accuracy ~ 0)."
20,Video Four,"Hi Harrison!

Firstly I'd thank you for providing us with such fluent tutorials. Your video series is among the best ones I found. It's much more elaborate, practical and useful than Udacity's course on the topic. 

I'd a doubt if you'd like to clarify.
I tried running the code shown here multiple times on my PC. To my astonishment, the accuracy improved each time I reran the code. Can you tell me the reason behind that? Is it so that if we train using the same data multiple times, the machine learns better? Also, I'd wish to know what exactly does preprocessing.scale(X) does and why is it necessary?"
21,Video Four,"@sentdex i'm doing your tutorial (almost all of them) and I think they are amazing, so thanks for all your help.

Anyway, in my IDE(Pycharm) the cross_validation module, are deprecated since 0.18, and will be removed in 0.20. Do we still use this module or try the model_selection, and how do we do this? thanks for all your help!"
22,Video Four,I love you man and your videos. Thank you so much for this. I was beginning to feel so disappointed and I thought I was never gonna learn anything about computer's software until I discovered your videos. Thanks again so freaking much!
23,Video Four,"Hi @sentdex! Apart from ""HL_pct"" and ""PCT_Change"", what other indicators might be useful to the algorithms? I tried using a CCI or a RSI as well, but the results are just worst... :("
24,Video Four,"Hi thanks for your sharing , thise are really helpful  
I have question 
I have an excel file with 21 rows and 10 columns with numbers , actually
I wanted to implement neural network with hidden layers, to know some missing items, 
I'm using MLPClassifier
Do you think this is a suitable way for doing this ? 


Also I have some error at the end: 
Unknown label type"
25,Video Four,"I think the reason that you got really low values using the svm.SVR() model is that you scaled the features, but not the label. You repeated this line: y = np.array(df['label']), where I think you meant to scale the label values with y = preprocessing.scale(y)"
26,Video Four,I love your videos! Thank you so much! They're really helpful.
27,Video Four,"Hey man, very nice tutorials!!. I really appreciate you share it. I have been writing my code while I watch the video everything works perfectly."
28,Video Four,"Hi thanks for the great video, it was a great help. I do have a question, how do I get the linear regression model in this form in python Y =b0  +b1 x +b3 y . Can you please guide me on this as I need the regression equation like this if I have 20 predictor variables and one output variable, and I would need the optimal regression equation for that? Thank you."
29,Video Four,"thanks so much! your explanation was very clear and didatic. I'm new on learning machine and I was almost freaking out with some material that I was using to study. Even if stocks are not my goal, your content was really rich (no jocke)."
30,Video Four,"Great video! I'm a relatively new 'coder' with just a year or so of experience, so I really appreciate how you break down everything so even I can understand.

One question I have. When I try the argument 'n_jobs = -1' on my code, I get an error that says it is an unexpected argument. I double-checked the documentation like you said and it looks like I spelt it correctly and such. Any idea what the issue might be? It works fine without the argument."
31,Video Four,"I was so lost about numpy and pandas, until I found your videos. Thanks, man!"
32,Video Four,"from doc about preprocessing:
Warning (Risk of data leak)
Do not use scale unless you know what you are doing. A common mistake is to apply it to the entire data before splitting into training and test sets.

But you used before splitting"
33,Video Four,Thanks for the opensource knowledge! You're a legend
34,Video Four,"Thanks for the videos, Harrison!
I have a couple of questions:

1)Which books, papers or webpages can you recommend me in order to learn the nitty gritty of the models? I personally feel bad about myself whenever I apply algorithms or mathematical methods without knowing how they work deep inside.
2) Why did you choose, in the cross validation, to set 'test_size' = 0.2? 

Thanks in Advance!"
35,Video Four,"For some reason, I am getting far worse scores on the SVR algorithm than you (-0.05), even though my linear regression works fine (0.96 score).I've been following along pretty closely, and I can't find any obviousÂ errorsÂ in my code.Â Do you have any idea what I might have done wrong?Also, as always, your tutorials are greatÂ and imensely helpful!"
36,Video Four,"Great video. Instead of score is it possible to visualize the performance. I am not quite sure what to plot. would like to see predicted against actual values , but somewhere I lost track"
37,Video Four,"Hi! I'm new to this series and I am enjoying it a lot! I have been spending a lot of time to understand a lot of the things you're covering. It seems to me that this course/series requires some prior knowledge besides Python basics? If so, where should I start? Thanks!"
38,Video Four,Truly amazing tutorials!
39,Video Four,"These tuts are very instructive, thanks for that and for the communicative passion!

One point to note on the accuracy number.  Isn't it quite logical that for GOOGL you'd get such a high number as the stock is basically  a straight line up, especially on a 30 days look back?"
40,Video Four,"@sentdex You have great communication skills and your speech is very clear which makes these videos a joy to go through. But one point of feedback i would like to give is that it will probably help to give examples sometimes. Especially when you were using panda shift in the earlier video and also in this video when u were using scaling and  talking about some other specific terms. I think maybe you assumed people would know something about regression or preprocessing before watching ur video but as a person who no idea of linear regression before watching this series, some of the stuff was going over my head and i had to stop do some looking up before proceeding. This was not necessarily a bad thing as i have a good foundation now but maybe something you can call out for others who are looking at your video series."
41,Video Four,I thought it would be basics first but you really  jumped to a high level
42,Video Four,"Hey guys, not sure if this helps anyone, but here's a link to an IPython notebook for this part of the series. I've made sure that the code works (Python 3). If anything gets broken in the future, feel free to let me know. 
https://github.com/GoPlayOutside/SentdexML/blob/master/PML%20Tutorial%20w%20Python%20pt4.ipynb"
43,Video Four,"Thanks a lot for your tutorials. I like some cool stuff which you explain, but I am lost other times. At times, I am confused what's the problem and why we do this or that. For example, I was lost in case of that forecast_col=forecast... Then, in case of X=preprocessing.scale(X)..., Why do we care about that? what are we tryting to achieve by doing this or that, in general whats the goal of this or that exercise. I check other comments and sometimes that helps. Seems, I am not the only one who is confused at times
. Thanks"
44,Video Four,"by default actually, svm uses, kernel='rbf', if you change it to linear it will result in the same percentage score(almost)"
45,Video Four,"In your data, the periodicity of the rows appears uniform. But how would you handle sparse data with varying periods? Shouldn't then the ""time"" or ""date"" itself be a feature?"
46,Video Four,"Hi, have a question. After shift(-30) we moving labels cells 30 up leaving 30 empty cells in this column. After dropna we delete that 30 lines. So next we predict last 30 labels (that we had since very beginning) using older features (:-30). What's point?"
47,Video Four,"default kernel for SVR is rbf(radial basis function) so to get better accuracy score use kernel='linear' the it will shoot the accuracy
SVR is a better classifier than LinearRegression as supports non linear classifiers"
48,Video Four,"I have a question : each time when we run as you've done the LinearRegression function we get different accuracies ; I guess because the train_test_split function is shuffling the dataset but to find THE REAL ACCUARCY ; How many times should we run the function to say it's enough .In addition to that , should we take the mean of all the accuarcies to say ok , my accuarcy is almost equal to ....blabla
Thank you"
49,Video Four,If you scale y (y = preprocessing.scale(y))  you will get an accuracy of almost 97% with SVM too.
50,Video Four,"Unknown label type: 'continuous' Error
I see that a lot of people have the above error when trying to fit their model.
It looks like most if not all tried to fit using 
clf=svm.SVC()
that is used for classification problems.
For continuous problems we use regression, hence use
clf=svm.SVR()
The funny thing is, that is clearly explained in sentdex python programming page, but seems nobody is paying attention to that."
51,Video Four,"As far as the deprecations go, 
 `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split `
and hence `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)` will fix that.

Also, at around 6:15 the `dropna` function won't do anything to the dataset with default parameters if it has no NaN elements. The forecast shift is something else entirely.

1 more thing - if you're getting NaN values in the array like I was you could use something like `nan_to_num` in numpy or use pandas for this. The below snippet works well: 

```
X = pd.DataFrame(df.drop(['label'], 1))
y = pd.DataFrame(df['label'])
df.dropna(inplace=True)

X = X.fillna(method = 'ffill')
y = y.fillna(method = 'ffill')
```"
52,Video Four,"I have a question. In the test data frame, does the machine predict features also using the training data frame? Or the machine only predicts labels using features present in test data frame?"
53,Video Four,is it right to scale the test and train data in single go or its better to scale separately?
54,Video Four,"Hey +sentdex, you tutorials are great.  Thanks for taking the time to put them together!

I'm getting a warning on CentOS 6.7 with Python 3.3.  I've Googled it as much as possible, but I'm not finding the solution and not sure how to upgrade LAPACK.  Hope you can offer some advice.

55,Video Four,"Hi Harrison , You are doing the great job by making the videos to give the chance to learn in an open source.Keep it up...
I am new to Machine Learning  just started learning it by seeing your videos.
Here in this video , I am not able to understand the relevance of shifting the Label column up by the one percent of the length of data frame and then deleting the Na records created due the shift, from the data frame . Won't it be the loss of  information carrying the latest trend. Please Guide.."
56,Video Four,"Dude thanks so much for these videos, they are really great!"
57,Video Four,"You generally don't want to include the column you are forecasting or any calculation on that column as an independent variable in linear regression. Obviously you will get high accuracy but the usefulness for prediction isn't high, because the greatest predictor of future price is the current price, directionally there is probably high variance and the model is overfitting."
58,Video Four,"greetings sentdex. im wondering, how will the machine not know the future label (for cross validation purpose) if some future labels are being used in the train set and test set of Y? (X_train,X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size=0.2)). How will this work with real unknown Y but has known Xs?"
59,Video Four,Truly appreciate what you are doing.
60,Video Four,I cant believe i JUST discovered this channel! Thank you for what you do!!!
61,Video Four,"in 5:16, i was curious to know as to why were you reassigning the 'y' value. What difference would that actually make? any input would be gladly appreciated."
62,Video Four,"Hi - could I check your HL_PCT calc? The calc in the code is based on comparing High to Close. If you want HL ratio, should that be: 
   df['HL_PCT'] = (df['Adj. High'] - df['Adj. Low']) / df['Adj. Low'] * 100.0
??

Great videos, btw!"
63,Video Four,It would be better to divide the data into train validation and test and then keep checking the metrics for validation because  in train test scenario we just look at test  data and improve which is sort of cheating
64,Video Four,"from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate, train_test_split
from sklearn import preprocessing, svm
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

Use the above snippet of code ^"
65,Video Four,"I'm a bit confused as to why it's necessary for us to state df.dropna(inplace=True) multiple times, could someone please enlighten me as to why this is the case?"
66,Video Four,"Case 1 - You've trained with human-0 and dog-1
Case 2 - You've trained with human-1 and dog-0 => using pre-trained weights from train Case 1
What effect on weights will I see. Will YOLO work well ,if I change the labels every time before training"
67,Video Four,"what I have observed is that you also need to have the understanding of the theoretical concepts of machine learning(for example what is gradient descent and what role does it play in linear regression) if you want to understand what exactly is happening when you are using these models.Another example is that you should know WHY we scale the features, what is learning rate, what is the effect of very low or very large learning rate etc. I have been following Andrew NG's course for machine learning and he is making learning the concepts very easy. However, since he is not using Python, I am following this series to understand the implementation in python. Combining both of these courses is a very deadly combination. I learn how everything is working from Andrew and implementing these algorithms is what I learn from these videos. I think that just going on with on thing is going to be difficult as you will either not understand the mathematical working our you might miss out on the implementation."
68,Video Four,"So, since the data is shuffled, does that mean that these models do not take into account the temporal relationship of the data (e.g. past 10 days closing prices) in their predictions?"
69,Video Four,For anyone who wants to understand more behind the logic of scaling and standardization: https://machinelearningmastery.com/rescaling-data-for-machine-learning-in-python-with-scikit-learn/
70,Video Four,"Great videos!!
The result coeffs of the linear regression are 4 values (clf.coef_)
How do you plot that? if it's not mX+B, then what is it?
I'd like to see the prediction graphically.
Thanks"
71,Video Four,"Great tutorial but when I run the code, the forecast values that appears in blue on the graph are not the future predictions but the last real values until today.

Any idea what can be the reason? (Python 3.4.2) Thanks!"
72,Video Four,"Great video but my accuracy is a lot lower (about 0.68) and I am just wondering if there is a regular cause of this due to some mistake I made, in which case I would have to change something before watching the next videos, or just if the data I am using is as good for training, in which case there would be nothing to worry about."
73,Video Four,What is sklearn linear regression's cost function? Can I change its cost function to some expression that I want to minimize instead of the default function?

81,Video Two,Who wants episode 2 of this?  Like and comment with your suggestions.
82,Video Two,I liked the way your covered realistic problems - boss v/s Chandoo. It gives fair comparison and absorb the learning.

84,Video Two,"Hi Chandoo, as always, your videos are simply amazing. Love the boss vs. you videos as it's a form of storytelling rather than the usual way of demonstrating the features."
85,Video Two,Legend has it that there is an uncountably infinite number of formulas and shortcuts in Excel for doing countably many things.
86,Video Two,You always amaze us with very nice tips and an interesting way to memorize them
87,Video Two,"These are super useful, amazingly simple tips and tricks as always :)"
88,Video Two,"Thanks, Sir! Exceptionally informative as always... and YES..., definitely looking forward to more of your videos in this ""Boss v/s Me"" format."
89,Video Two,"Liked these quick and useful tips! Won't mind seeing more of ""Boss v/s Me"" videos, but we know that Chandoo in himself is ""Excel Boss""!"
90,Video Two,This was super creative and a great approach. Looking forward to Part 2
91,Video Two,"This was kinda.... genius!!!!!!!
Such a clever way to teach - an entertaining way to set a relatable scenario from which to contextualise the benefit of the more advanced technique and then see in real time with meaningful examples how to actually do it better.  I'm genuinely so impressed (I mean I am that guy who loves a good excel shortcut for no particular reason anyways, but still - awesome) First video of yours I've watched. Think I'm gonna have to sub lol."
92,Video Two,"I love this type of my boss presentation, real life situation examples especially as an analyst wanting to show your worth to the team."
93,Video Two,"I am following Chandoo dilligently  around year and a half now, and I can note that the  content growth is amazing and inspiring since i am learning a lot myself. The adjastability to consumer needs is up to date, easy to follow, adjuatable to feedback. Me vs Boss trend is greatly done, the format is nice, i would suggest since this is a tik tok ðŸ«° format to try to reduce the length as much as possible, not necessarily in minutes (i would suggest 4-5min top) and just divide the content to include up to 3 ideas in one video. For example I would cut this video in formatting tips, and adding blank rows,2nd one for reports  pivot tables and adjusting charts in another sheet and a third one for dates in excel or the sequence formula. This is my pov as the new generation wants everything in seconds and i think thats the target audience for this series. Lots of"
94,Video Two,Fun and informative. I vote yes for episode 2. Thumbs up!
95,Video Two,"Incredible and helpful as always! Thank you, @Chandoo!"

And would love to have a series of Chandoo Vs Boss!!!"
102,Video Two,"I enjoy all the video formats you create but this one is especially good. Excellent work.

-Ajay"
103,Video Two,it was exciting to watch. I hope you do more videos related to boss vs employee.
104,Video Two,Your videos are very good and informative....You teach us with the help of hands on practice....Today I also like the funny part 3:30 to 3:37.
105,Video Two,"I don't know if someone has mentioned but if you have a text value TN001, you can just autofill that and it will increment by one"
106,Video Two,Thank you Chandoo. What a humorous way to teach excel.

108,Video Two,Nice one.. keep showing him who's the boss.. looking forward to more of this series
109,Video Two,"Hi. The video was very helpful. But in the first instance, where you press ctrl and select each row to insert data, it would be cumbersome to use the technique where there is huge data. Do we need to press ctrl and each row or is there is any other technique? Pressing shift and the row doesn't help."
110,Video Two,Thank you. This is so informative. Also entertaining!
111,Video Two,Really like and appreciate your tutorial!! Thank you a ton!
112,Video Two,"Awesome video, I am not even a excel learner but tricks like these are helpful. your unique method of teaching is plus 1. keep it up.

113,Video Two,"Great tips! Do you have content on creating a dynamic task list in Excel? One where tasks can be checked off and the tasks is then highlighted, crossed out, or faded."
114,Video Two,"I'm weak on formulas, always use VBA to solve my problems, like create a UDF if I need a special function to calculate something. The SEQUENCE() function, for example, I'd probably write a VBA equivalent because I didn't even know it exists. And I had no idea about spill columns. I believe your channel will help a lot with my weakness. Thank you for sharing."

307,Video Seven,"i reached the 4 masterclass and then... when i tried to upload the image like you did i got  this ""the uploaded file could not be moved to wp-content""  im using xampp as well and is a local host it should work right?

it seems it has to do with a permission issue, so i found out about filezilla, and tried to use it to change the permission to 755 or 777 but whenever i attempt to do it i get ""500 wrong command""

and i cant even log in the filezilla and xampp forums to ask about this, cause the verification e-mail is never sent to any e-mail i attempt to use to register.

			INTRODUCTION
1.SQL is a technical language which is used to access and interact with Relational DBMS.
2.A Relational DBMS is simply a software application which is used to create and manage databases.
3.MySQL is one of the most popular and basic example of Relational database software.
	Some other examples include Oracle,postgreSQL,mariaDB
4.Some examples of non-relaional database softwares are mongoDB,dynamoDB,apache cassandra,firebase.
5.A database is a collection of similar type of data stored in various forms.
6.A DBMS is a special software program which is used to create and manage databases
	..>Maintain huge amounts of data
	..>Create backups
	..>Provide Security
	..>Import/Export Data
	..>Concurrency
	..>Also interacts with various software applications using different programming languages. 
7.C.R.U.D is an ancronym which stands for Create Read/Retrieve Update Delete. These 4 major operations are often performed on databases
8.Majorly 2 types of databases:-
Relational:- a)Data is organized systematically in one or two tables
	     b)Data is organized into rows,columns
	     c)Every row has a unique key
Non-Relational:-Anything which is not rational(traditional tables)
	        a)Flexible tables
		b)Key-value stores
		c)Documents
		d)Graphs
9.Structured Query Language
..>Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
..>Used for creating tables and structures
..>Used to perform C.R.U.D operations on databases along with other administrative tasks(user management,security,backup)
..>SQL code used on one RDBMS cannot always be portable to other RDBMS without slight modification. 
10.Queries are requests made to the DBMS for specific information
   ..>Complex the DataBase Structure-Harder to acquire the wanted pieces of information
   ..>EX:-A google search is a query 

    		 TABLES AND KEYS
11.Columns=Attributes
   Rows=Entries
12.Every table has a primary key. A primary key is an special attribute which uniquely defines every row.
13.Surrogate key is a type of primary key which has no mapping to anything in the real world.(Food-id)
14.A natural key is a type of primary key which has a mapping or relation with the entry in real world(Ex:-Aadhar Number)
15.Foreign key is a special attribute which links the entries of one table with another table in the form of primary key.
   Defines the relationship between two tables.
   A foreign key may also link the relationships among entries of the same table. 
16.Sometimes,one primary key may have to specify two rows with same value.
   To solve that we use composite key which is a combination of two primary keys.
   In a composite key,a single primary key cannot uniquely identify each entry of the table,but when two primary keys are put together they can uniquely identify each key.
   No two corresonding values in a composite key are same.
17.Sometimes two primary keys of a composite key maybe foreign keys(linking to as other tables' primary keys).
		SQL BASICS
18.SQL is basically a hybrid language basically stuffed with 4 different types of languages:-
	1.Data Query Language(DQL)
		..>Used for querying some specific information(which is already stored in the database)
	2.Data Definition Language(DML)
		..>Used for defining data base schemas
	3.Data Control Language(DCL)
		..>Used for managing the access of data 
		..>used in administrative tasks(user management,security,backup)
	4.Data Manipulation Language(DML)
		..>Used to perform C.R.U.D operations on databases
 		
19.PopSQL is a modern SQL editor which is majorly being used these days on teams.It allows employees to write/submit sql queries,share the results and visualize the data.

		Create Tables
20.The Core SQL Data Types Are:-
				INT-Whole Number
				Decimal(M,N)-Exact Decimal Value{M represents total digits and N represents total digits after the decimal point}
				VARCHAR(n)-A textual string with a maximum of n characters
				BLOB-Large Binary Object used to store large data
				DATE-'YYYY-MM-DD'
				TIMESTAMP-'YYYY-MM-DD' 'HH-MM-SS'

21.			BASIC OPERATIONS
a)Create a table
b)Describe the table
b)Delete(Drop) a table
c)Specifying the PRIMARY KEY
d)Alter a table i.e add a column
e)Alter a table i.e delete a column
f)INSERT INTO
g)INSERT INTO (only some attributes to be filled)
...>Note:-We have two ways of avoiding writing a value{directly and indirectly}
          {Directly means writing NULL while filling values. Indirectly means skipping that unwanted attribute while writing the attributes names in () beside table_name while filling the values} 
h)SELECT * FROM 
 Note:-No Duplicate Entries Under the Primary Key
 Note:-DESCRIBE,INSERT INTO and SELECT need not be written with TABLE keyword


22.			CONSTRAINTS
...>These are written besides the attribute name while specifying
a)NOT NULL {You will have to fill up that attribute}
b)UNIQUE   {All values under that attribute will have to be different from each other}
c)DEFAULT ''{When you indirectly don't fill up an attribute,it will automatically fill up that space with default ''} 
Note:-A primary key is by nature NOT NULL and UNIQUE
d)AUTO_INCREMENT {When specified beside any attribute,it will automatically assign 1,2,3,4... but you will have to indirectly skip that attribute while filling values}

23.			UPDATE AND DELETE
a)UPDATE tablename
  SET name='Imran'
  WHERE name='Uzair'
Note:-We can also update value under an attribute with the reference of value under another attribute(as shown below)
b)UPDATE student
  SET major='java'
  WHERE student_id=5
c)We can update value for multiple references using OR
d)We can update multiple values for single/multiple references using ,
e)We can update all values under an attribute as a common single value.
Note:-You can use OR and AND in WHERE but only AND in SET  {here AND in SET should be denoted using comma only}
 
f)DELETE FROM student
  WHERE name='faiz';
Note:-You can use OR and AND in WHERE
g)WHERE is like if condition in programming whereas SET is like the set of instruction you want to execute.The condition is also called prompt.
			BASIC QUERIES
a)To rename a table
                   RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;
b)To print selected columns
			   SELECT table_name.column_name
			   FROM table_name;
c)To print multiple selected columns
			   SELECT table_name.column_name,table_name.column_name
			   FROM table_name;
d)Along with printing a column or columns you can also arrange the values of an attribute in ascending or descending order
			   SELECT column_name,column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   ORDER BY column_name;  {Ascending Order}

			   SELECT column_name,column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   ORDER BY column_name DESC;  {Descending Order} 
e)Along with printing column or columns you can also arrange multiple columns in ascending or descending order
			   SELECT column_name,column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   ORDER BY column_name,column_name;  {Ascending Order(The first mentioned column will be sorted and if it contains any 2 same values,they will be sorted w.r.t second column order}
 Note:-Ascending/Descending does not apply to integers
f)You can impose a limit on number of rows you want to print
	             	   SELECT column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   LIMIT 2;			      {You can also order if you wish}
g)Till now we printed desired columns,we printed in an order using ORDER BY and then we also imposed a limit  
  Now we will print only those columns which satisfy a particular condition
			   SELECT column_name,column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   WHERE column_name='' AND column_name<5;  {You can use >,<,>=,<=,=,<>}
h)Insted of = you can use IN('','')
			   SELECT column_names
			   FROM table_name
			   WHERE column_name IN ('value1','value2','value3')
i)Along with printing selected columns of a table you can change the name of those selected columns to be printed in the output
			   SELECT first_name AS fore_name,last_name AS sur_name
			   FROM employee;
j)To know the various categories of values under a particular column
			   SELECT DISTINCT sex
 			   FROM employee;

			SCHEMA
a)A database schema is a skeleton structure of the database that represents the logical view of the entire database.
b)A parent table is the one which includes the foreign key.
c)A child table is the one that has the attribute to which the parent table's foreign key refers.
d)To specify a foreign key,we do it inside CREATE TABLE table_name(
							           FOREIGN KEY attribute_name REFERS child_table_name(attrribute_name) ON DELETE SET NULL
									);
e)ON DELETE SET NULL{on deleting of a row in parent table,the value in child table w.r.t foreign key becomes NULL}
f)e)ON DELETE CASCADE{on deleting of a row in parent table,the corresponding row in child table gets deleted}
Note:-a)Do not specify the foreign key in parent table until you have created a child table
        After creating child table,you may add foreign key for the parent table by ALTER TABLE table_name ADD attribute_name data_type; 	
      b)In the parent table,do not fill the values for foreign key.Better fill the foreign keys initially as NULL.
        After filling values in child table,UPDATE the foreign key values of parent table.
Note:-You cannot DROP(delete) the parent table without deleting the child table.
			FUNCTIONS
a)Syntax:-
	  SELECT func_name(column_name)
	  FROM table_name;
b)COUNT() - Counts the total number of values under a column
c)AVG() -  Finds the average of values under a column
d)SUM() - Finds the sum of values under a column
			AGGREGATION
a)To know the number of employees belonging to each city
	  SELECT COUNT(city),city
	  FROM employee
	  GROUP BY city;
b)To know the total sales of each employee id
	  SELECT SUM(total_sales),emp_id
	  FROM works_with
	  GROUP BY emp_id;"

378,Video Six,The best course for the SQL! You made it so easy to understand! Thanks
379,Video Six,The way you have explained the concepts is very good. You made it simpler to understand. Any non-technical person can also understand it easily. I had worked on RDBMS briefly many years ago and going through your course made me recall all the concepts. Thank you so much.
380,Video Six,Thank you Mike! You are an excellent teacher. Very intelligent and easy to understand.
381,Video Six,"Thank Mike for your great work, you are really gifted with teaching. Best wishes."

392,Video Six,"Just a minor correction at 02:39:14 - Instead of ""birth_date > 1971-01-01"" it should instead be ""birth_date >= 1971-01-01"" or alternatively ""birth_date > 1970-12-31"" since we are considering all dates after the last date of the year 1970 and querying with ""birth_date > 1971-01-01"" will exclude people born on Jan 1st 1971 which is not what we intend. Rest the video is just awesome af ! Thanks for this amazing video ."
393,Video Six,Thank you sooo much  for this. You're the best SQL tutor out there. Can someone explain to me when to know to use a nested query and when to use a join? A bit confused on that aspect
394,Video Six,I can't emphasize enough how much I absolutely love that all the data was from The Office. Literally made this tutorial even better. Thanks!
395,Video Six,I missed my database class in university and when my teacher gave project with a very short deadline I was at a loss. I started watching the video with a hope and it was like a blessing. I created a beautiful database and got one of the highest scores in my class. Thanks sir for teaching this concept beautifully for free.
396,Video Six,"WOW! So much information. I love how you explain it so simply. I'm new at this, so hopefully, I'll get to learn more with your videos."

467,Video Three,"The most motivational concept to start the day for studies  is :-

Select ""good day"" from days
where person = ""you"" 

 Thanks Chandoo for being with us . I am on the journey of being a Data analyst though I have a 5 years experience as an Oracle Database Administrator. Your videos are the quick go to for me whenever I need to complete something qualitative in short time ."
468,Video Three,@ 20:58 The logic behind why Weekday(SaleDay) as 'Day of Week' does not work in the Where clause is because...The Select Part is the projection Part of SQL and it happens last.Since it happens after Where Clause it has no idea what 'Day of Week' is.... which is a calculated column in Select part.Hence it does not work.
469,Video Three,"this such an amazing video ... if you follow things side by side on MySql Workbench, that's the best learning..."

I had a issue for the last two Queries in Join and group by when I do the Last one or the last but one I ma not getting the After nine Product at all, does anyone have similar issue."
477,Video Three,"you are such a talented teacher..
thank-you so much for teaching us"
478,Video Three,.sql file is not opening either in mysql or sql developer. It'd have been better if the practice dataset were provided in .csv format. That would have made it so much easier for me to follow. Thanks anyway for the wonderful tutorial.
479,Video Three,great video to learn basics of SQL
480,Video Three,You seem to have explained certain unnecessary things but failed to explain in depth how certain sql worked. Eg. In the inner join between sales and team and another table you said there are rows where there's no team name since the employee belongs to no team. So this perhaps worked as a left outer join for sales or perhaps your tables aren't normalized.
481,Video Three,"That is what I'm looking for. Thanks, chandoo sir from my bottom of my heart 
love from India"
482,Video Three,Need more videos like this it teach us a lot
